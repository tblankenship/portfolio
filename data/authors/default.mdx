I'm a senior solutions architect at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). I enjoy learning new things, and spend my time outside of work dabbling on small projects.

Most recently, I have focused my time on:

- Music Production
- Card tricks / magic
- Photography
- Japanese Study
- Travel (and hacking it as much as possible)
