## Life after work

Financial Independence was a very simple concept for me to get behind. I grew up as a reasonably frugal person thanks to my parents, so kicking that into overdrive once I started working made sense. I didn't even bat an eye when I heard about the FIRE movement and when I heard about people saving 50%+ of their income. From there, it became an obsession. I've always enjoyed what I do, but
especially over the past few years I have put almost all of my hobbies and interests on hold in the name of _building financial stability_ and _growing my career_. **Net worth calculators turned into a real life video game, where I had a high score that I constantly needed to increase.**

During these last few years, I have read stories from those who hit their retirement number, retired, and realized they were running **away** from something (a bad job typically) instead of running **to** retirement. The story usually played out like this: they would retire, stay at home and watch tv and play video games, and end up being depressed nearly 6 months later.

Every time I've heard those stories I think to myself _"That won't be me. I have hobbies. I have things I like to do. I have a plan for myself once I'm financially free..."_ And, I _do_ have those things. I plan on working throughout my life - maybe not in software, but still working, or creating, but the more I reflect on these last few years the more I have realized I don't really know what my biggest hobbies _are_. I love cars, learning new technology, learning languages, and being physically active, but I've never dove deep into any of them. Maybe that's that's okay for hobbies, but I feel like a part of me is scared of diving deeper into a skill due to fear of not being good at it. Right now it's easy for me to say "I've dabbled in that, I know a little bit about it", but I never seem to take the leap to go from dabbler to active pursuer or true hobbiest.

So, what happens when I'm done working a 9-5 and I can dive into these hobbies more? I would like to think that I would spend most of my day on these (or to-be-discovered) hobbies, but the truth is I may be using my job as a scapegoat to mask that I might not care about these hobbies as much as I tell myself I would.
