## Life update

In my usual fashion, I have't posted anything in quite a few months. I had a little free time this evening so I thought I would add an update in hopes that I can begin to be more active on here.
After almost a year at Studio, I ended up leaving - and have found myself at AWS as a Solutions Architect! It was quite the process to prepare and interview for. I'm hoping to post a little about
the process I went through, as long as a few tips for anyone looking into a role at Amazon.

## What's next

I'm not too sure about the next direction of the blog. Obviously there's not much content on here. I decided to remove the data stucture and
algorithm posts I had on here for a few reasons. The main purpose of posting those pieces was to keep me accountable and to keep pushing myself
to practice and prepare for interviews. There's plenty of much better resources for those problems on the internet, so no need to keep mine on here!

After looking through my about page I realized quite a lot has changed. I took a pause on music production and some of my other creative endeavours
to focus on work; the first few months have been fairly busy.

I'm hoping to spend some time building a fun project outside of work - I haven't written much code in the last few months, and I miss creating. I'm still in the ideating
phase of that - so hopefully there will be an update soon!
