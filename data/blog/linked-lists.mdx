## Ex 1:

[Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

Option 1 (Iterative):

```python
class Solution:
    def reverse_list(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        prev, current = None, head

        while current:
            # Set a temporary pointer to next node
            temp = current.next
            current.next = prev
            prev = current
            current = temp
        return prev
```

Complexity: O(n)

Option 2 (Recursive):

```python
class Solution:
    def reverse_list(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        if not head or not head.next: return head

        newHead = self.reverse_list(head.next)
        # Same as making a temp and swapping the pointer direction
        head.next.next = head
        head.next = None

        return newHead
```

## Ex 2:

[Merge Two Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

```python
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, list1: Optional[ListNode], list2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        #dummy and cur point at the same node
        dummy = cur = ListNode()

        while list1 and list2:
            #move current next pointer to first item in list with a smaller value
            if list1.val < list2.val:
                cur.next = list1
                list1 = list1.next
            else:
                cur.next = list2
                list2 = list2.next

            #move pointer of current up one
            cur = cur.next

        #add rest of list if one of the lists is empty
        if list1:
            cur.next = list1
        elif list2:
            cur.next = list2

        return dummy.next
```

Complexity: O(n)
