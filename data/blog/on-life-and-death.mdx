## On life and death

I've been thinking about mortality a lot recently - thanks for a few books that I have read this past month. The first - [Being Mortal](http://atulgawande.com/book/being-mortal/), by Atul Gawande - has made me think about aging and what the final years of my life will bring. Following that I read [Die with Zero](https://www.diewithzerobook.com/welcome) by Bill Perkins, which argues that the currency of life should be life experiences over money. Both of these books have reminded me of possibly my favorite blog post of all time on the internet - [The Tail End](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html) on **Wait but Why**. This blog post beautifully illustrates how finite life really is. If you or I live to 90 years, we only have X number of Christmases, X days at the beach, and/or X days with our parents left.

Although a somber thought, I think there's optimism in this thinking as well. Stocism takes this idea further with the quote _"Momento Mori"_ - **Remember you must die**. The idea is that today may be your last day to live, so live your life as if it were. If today was your last day to live, what would you do differently? How would you handle your actions and responses with others? What would you spend your time doing? _Momento Mori_ is a great reminder for me to slow down when I am frustrated, and to be a little more patient with someone. Beyond that though, thinking about death has been reminding me that there is more to life than working and acquiring money.

## Life beyond financial accumulation

Financial Independence was a very simple concept for me to get behind. I grew up as a reasonably frugal person thanks to my parents, so kicking that into overdrive once I started working made sense. I didn't even bat an eye when I heard about the FIRE movement and when I heard about people saving 50%+ of their income. From there, it became an obsession. I've always enjoyed what I do, but
especially over the past few years I have put almost all of my hobbies and interests on hold in the name of _building financial stability_ and _growing my career_. **Net worth calculators turned into a real life video game, where I had a high score that I constantly needed to increase.**

Through these last few years I have read stories from those who hit their retirement number, retired, and realized they had nothing else going for them.
