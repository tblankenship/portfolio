## Crabs in a bucket

A few months ago, I was at lunch with some coworkers. The conversation during lunch eventually degraded to
complaints about current and previous jobs. Someone made a comment about how that's just the way work is,
and eluded to their paycheck being the only reason they were working. After the conversation, I couldn't
help but feel like a crab in a bucket; unable to escape workplace hell. I'm not saying my current workplace is hell,
just that the mentality of hating work and just doing work to get a paycheck is hell - at least it is for me.

I'm working at my full-time job over 25% of my life - over 40% if you consider my waking hours. I get that some
people aren't passionate about what they do, and maybe that works for some people, but it doesn't work for me. I want
to build. I want to work on hard problems. I want to grow and learn and look forward to each day of work. Obviously
there are days that there's a lot of life going on, and I'm not expecting to love every aspect of a job, but I LIKE
to work. When I hear others complain about their jobs and how much they don't like them all I can about is how
depressing that must be. 40% of your hours awake being frustrated, complaining, etc...

## The better way

I met with a mentor of mine last week. As we were catching up, he mentioned that many people early in their careers
over-index on salary raises instead of focusing on personal growth and experience. I never understood the importance
of focusing on investing in my own skills until recently. I know I'm coming from a privileged point of view, but I've
finally realized that I'm going to be financially stable and fine unless something incredibly catastrophic happens.
If that's the case, then why am I trying to get more money and salary? I know I want to work, and will continue to
work after I'm financially independent, so working somewhere simply for a paycheck is a fool's errand. I've only got
one life, so I want to fill it with work and experiences that help me be the best person I possibly can be.

## The currency of life

In the book "Die With Zero", by Bill Perkins, Bill suggests that the true currency of life is experience, not money.
Money is simply a tool for you to live your life. We trade money for expereinces. Quite literally in my career, I
shouldn't be trading experience for more money, as experiences and memories are the most imporant things we have in life.
