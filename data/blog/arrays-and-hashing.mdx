## Ex 1:

[Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

```python
class Solution:
    def contains_duplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:

        hash_set = set()

        for n in nums:
            if n in hash_set:
                return True
            else:
                hash_set.add(n)

        return False
```

Complexity: O(n)

## Ex 2:

[Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

```python
class Solution:
    def is_anagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        dic = {}

        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False

        for c in s:
            if c not in dic:
                dic[c] = 1
            else:
                dic[c] += 1

        for c in t:
            if c not in dic:
                return False
            else:
                dic[c] -= 1
            if dic[c] == 0:
                del dic[c]

        if len(dic) == 0:
            return True

        return False
```

Complexity: O(n)

## Ex 3:

(Two Sum)[https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/]

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:

        hashMap = {}

        for i, n in enumerate(nums):
            difference = target - n
            if difference in hashMap:
                return [hashMap[difference], i]
            hashMap[n] = i

            return []

```
