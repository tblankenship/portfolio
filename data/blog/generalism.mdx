## Jack of all trades, master of none

I feel like I can attribute most of my successes in life to being a generalist. Being _okay_ at a lot of things ends up
being a easier to do than being the best at one or two things. At the end of the day, there's always going to be someone
else who wants to spend more time honing their craft, studying, or working. Plus, they might just be more skilled in an
area than I am regardless of how much time I put into something.

Being a generalist a mix of skills and experience that can usually solve problems in a mix of ways - but can also lead to
solutions being less than ideal. But, you end up getting a solution out the door, which is all that matters sometimes. A
les-than-ideal solution is better than no solution at all.

Stacking multiple skills and experiences ends up creating a very unique skillset for almost every individual - which is why I
think so many peolpe end up being fairly generalist - at least in most areas. In fact, the quote about being a Jack of all
trades specifically was calling this out. We often hear the first half of the quote as "Jack of all trades, master of none,
but the whole quote reads:

> “A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.”

This quote - originally a compliment to imply a person is skilled in multiple areas - seems to now have a semi-negative connotation
that someone isn't really good at anything. As a generalist, I often feel that about myself.

## The case for being a specialist

I work with very smart and talented people. I'm often faced with imposter syndrome when I see some of the incredible work my
teammates do. The process typically looks something like this:

- Thinking to myself: **_"Why can't I come up with solutions as elegant as them?"_** or **_"I wish I were as good at them at picking up new skills."_**"
- I'll make a note of learning about their solution and how I should research it in the future.
- I'll look it up in my free time, and decide after 2 hours that it's probably better that I don't spend hours of my life learning something that I most likely won't be use in my career.

So, why do I never push myself more to go deeper into areas like niche technologies, or invest deeper in developing my hobbies?
This is why I think being a specialist, or at least adopting a specialist mindset is important to do - at least for me - and
probably others who find themselves in the generalist camp.

## Limit beliefs

When you see someone do something impressive, is your first thought _"I think I could do that with enough practice"_
or _"I won't ever be able to do that"_? Maybe it depends on what you are seeing the person do. Why though? Why do we wave our
hand away at seemindly impossible tasks instead of pushing to attempt them? Or maybe this isn't that common and I just
end up doing mental gymnastics to try to justify why I'm not good at something.

Either way, I wanted to refelct on why I do that at least. I think the older I get and the more I go through my life routines,
the less willing I am to pick up new skills. Sort of like "life golden handcuffs". I only have so much time and mental energy
in a day to do things, and with work and my other hobbies I don't have the time to learn everything that sounds interesting to me.

## If I just had enough time

So, in the end, it's about time - or at least that's how it feels to me. If I had unlimited time would I actually learn all of these
things? _Could_ I learn that many things? Even with unlimited time, the human brain definitely has limits of hwo much knowledge it can hold -
especially when so many crafts require deep levels of memorization to successful.

## Learning

Learning by doing works much better than simply viewing because you're not just memorizing a process - you're making teh connections in
your brain to build a process that works uniquely for you.
